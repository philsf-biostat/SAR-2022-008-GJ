# Abbreviations

- CI: confidence interval
- FEVS: Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey
- OPM: U.S. Office of Personnel Management

# Context

The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) addressed leadership commitment, professional development, and telework satisfaction while accounting for gender (OPM, 2020).
This analysis addresses a subset of the FEVS survey reflecting NASA employees.

## Objectives

Test if there is an association between leadership commitment and
telework employee satisfaction
at NASA from the 2020 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey.

## Data reception and cleaning

Raw data was collected as a census of the eligible population (OPM, 2020), and statistical weighting was applied at the data collection to adjust for non-responses in in the census attempt.
These survey weights allow for the estimation of the association under study in the source population.
The raw data is expected to reflect a total employee population at NASA at 16809 employees but after cleaning procedures the observations in the analytical data represents a total of 15283 NASA employees.
Survey questions measured responses in a 5-point Likert scale between 1 (strongly disagree) and 5 (strongly agree).
Some questions offered the option to choose "X" (Don't know) as the answer.
These unknown answers were considered non-answers and treated as missing values.

All variables in the analytical set were labeled according to the raw data provided and values were labeled according to the data dictionary for the preparation of production-quality results tables and figures.
This analysis will focus on two questions from the FEVS survey, where the main interest is employee satisfaction
(q1 -- I am given a real opportunity to improve my skills in my organization)
as the dependent variable and leadership commitment
(q21 -- Supervisors in my work unit support employee development)
as the independent variable.
As per the data cleaning process, the dependent variable was renamed to `dv` and the independent variable was renamed to `iv` in the analytical dataset.
After the cleaning process 5 variables were included in the analysis with 9633 observations.

# Methods

## Variables

### Primary and secondary outcomes

**Primary outcome**

This analysis does not evaluate an outcome variable, but instead tests whether or not the distributions of answers from two questions are independent from one another.

### Covariates

The association will be stratified by the sex of survey respondents.

## Statistical analyses

The epidemiological profile of the study participants will be described.
Demographic
(sex, age and BMI)
will be described as
mean (SD)
<!-- median (IQR) -->
or as counts and proportions (%), as appropriate.
All comparisons between groups will be performed as univariate analyses.
Differences in distribution of categorical variables will be assessed with the
chi-square test with the adjustment of design effect for weighted survey data.
All evaluations will be performed as complete case analyses.
All analyses will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version 4.1.2.

# Results

## Study population and follow up

The sample evaluated in this study is comprised of 9633 observations representing 15283 NASA employees, out of a total of 16809.
Two thirds of the study population are males (66.4%, Table 1).

<!-- The first survey question -->
Both survey questions
addressed in this study showed most NASA employees demonstrated high levels of satisfaction when the survey was conducted.
The proportion of employees that agree or strongly agree with the main outcome of this study
(q1 -- I am given a real opportunity to improve my skills in my organization)
was 88.5%.
The proportion of employees that agree or strongly agree with leadership commitment
(q21 -- Supervisors in my work unit support employee development)
was 93.1%.


Table: **Table 1** Characteristics of the study population. Each of the survey questions had 5 alternatives for answer: 1: strongly disagree, 2: disagree, 3: neither agree nor disagree, 4: agree, 5: strongly agree.

### Stratification by sex

- males: p<0.001
- females: p<0.001

The overall association appears to have an interaction with sex.

- CMH: p<0.001

CMH test confirms an interaction is detectable.

#### Additional analyses

- sex and iv: p=0.402
- sex and dv: p=0.195

Sex is not associated with either leadership commitment or employee satisfaction.
