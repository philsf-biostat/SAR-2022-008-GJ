# Context

The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) addressed leadership commitment, professional development, and telework satisfaction while accounting for gender (OPM, 2020).
This analysis addresses a subset of the FEVS survey reflecting NASA employees.

## Objectives

Quantify the association between leadership commitment and
employee professional development
at NASA from the 2020 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey.

## Data reception and cleaning

Raw data was collected as a census of the eligible population (OPM, 2020), and statistical weighting was applied at the data collection to adjust for non-responses in in the census attempt.
These survey weights (variable `postwt`) allow for the estimation of the association under study in the source population.
The raw data was filtered to reflect only NASA survey respondents (where agency code equals `NN`).

The raw data is expected to reflect a total employee population at NASA at 16809 employees but after cleaning procedures the observations in the analytical data represents a total of 15283 NASA employees.
Survey questions measured responses in a 5-point Likert scale between 1 (strongly disagree) and 5 (strongly agree).
Some questions offered the option to choose "X" (Don't know) as the answer.
These unknown answers were considered non-answers and treated as missing values.

All variables in the analytical set were labeled according to the raw data provided and values were labeled according to the data dictionary for the preparation of production-quality results tables and figures.
This analysis will focus on two questions from the FEVS survey, where the main interest is employee satisfaction
(q1 -- I am given a real opportunity to improve my skills in my organization)
as the dependent variable and leadership commitment
(q21 -- Supervisors in my work unit support employee development)
as the independent variable.
As per the data cleaning process, the dependent variable was renamed to `dv` and the independent variable was renamed to `iv` in the analytical dataset.
Additionally, to calculate the OR the responses were categorized as binary responses, where agreement was aggregated from the "agree" and "strongly agree" responses, in variables `dv2` and `iv2`.
After the cleaning process 7 variables were included in the analysis with 9633 observations.

# Methods

## Variables

### Primary and secondary outcomes

**Primary outcome**

Odds of participants
that perceive opportunities of employee professional development
at NASA from the 2020 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey.

### Covariates

The association will be stratified by the sex of survey respondents.

## Statistical analyses

The epidemiological profile of the study participants will be described.
Demographic
(sex, age and BMI)
will be described as
mean (SD)
<!-- median (IQR) -->
or as counts and proportions (%), as appropriate.
All comparisons between groups will be performed as univariate analyses.
Differences in distribution of categorical variables will be assessed with the
chi-square test with the adjustment of design effect for weighted survey data.
The OR will be used as a measure of effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable.
The stratification by sex will be used to assess if the effect changes across male and female strata.
As a rule of thumb, a minimum change of 20% in the OR will be considered before concluding that there is an interaction between sex and the independent variable.
The homogeneity of the OR across strata will be assessed with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.
All evaluations will be performed as complete case analyses.
All analyses will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version 4.1.2.

# Results

## Study population and follow up

The sample evaluated in this study is comprised of 9633 observations representing 15283 NASA employees, out of a total of 16809.
Two thirds of the study population are males (66.4%, Table 1).

<!-- The first survey question -->
Both survey questions
addressed in this study showed most NASA employees demonstrated high levels of satisfaction when the survey was conducted.
The proportion of employees that agree or strongly agree with the main outcome of this study
(q1 -- I am given a real opportunity to improve my skills in my organization)
was 88.5%.
The proportion of employees that agree or strongly agree with leadership commitment
(q21 -- Supervisors in my work unit support employee development)
was 93.1%.


Table: **Table 1** Characteristics of the study population. Each of the survey questions had 5 alternatives for answer: 1: strongly disagree, 2: disagree, 3: neither agree nor disagree, 4: agree, 5: strongly agree.

## Association between leadership commitment and professional development

### Overall association

In order to compare how the responses to the leadership commitment and
<!-- telework satisfaction -->
employee development
relate to each other, a cross-tabulation of all answers from each study participant is shown in Table 2.
There is a detectable statistical difference in the distributions of the two responses (see section Observations), where the chi-square adjusted for survey design was significant.

This cross tabulation shows that the largest proportion of survey respondents answered 4 (agree) or 5 (strongly agree) to both questions.
This means that there is a detectable association between leadership commitment and
<!-- telework satisfaction. -->
employee development.
Considering this is a high-powered study, this could be due to statistical power alone, meaning that while a difference in proportions is detectable this analysis does not inform how large this difference is.

The effect size of this association will be reported in the next section.

### Stratification by sex

In order to estimate the size of the effect of the association a binary categorization was performed between the two survey responses, where agreement aggregates all answers 4 (agree) and 5 (strongly agree).
Table 3 shows the contingency table that cross-tabulates these variables.
There is a detectable statistical difference in the distributions of the two responses (see section Observations), where the chi-square adjusted for survey design was significant.

The effect of the association was significant (OR: 26.81, 95% CI: [23.25, 30.96]).
This means that when survey respondents perceive leadership commitment, they are 27 times as likely to report
<!-- telework satisfaction -->
employee development
as participants that do not perceive such commitment from leadership.
Alternatively this translates to a 26-fold increase in the group of interest when compared to the reference group.

|Agree                                                         |       1,043 (59)        |      13,179 (97)      |             |719 (61)                |      8,768 (98)      |             |       324 (55)        |4,411 (97)           |             |

In order to control for a possible interaction between the association and the sex of the study participant, the analysis was replicated for each sex.
In both cases the chi-square test was significant (see section Observations), meaning that a possible interaction is detectable, and this possibility is confirmed by the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (p<0.001).

The effect sizes for males and females were similar to each other (OR: 27.26, 95% CI: [22.78, 32.70] and females: OR: 26.36, 95% CI: [20.84, 33.51]).
These effect sizes do not fall in the rule of thumb of accepting a difference in the OR of up to 0.2 as similar so after controlling for sex, the association is affected by sex.

This means that, when they perceive leadership commitment, men appear to show higher levels of
<!-- telework satisfaction -->
employee development
than women,
when compared to the reference group.

Although the difference in the overall OR and the sex-stratified ORs is larger than 1, it can be noted that the relative difference between these ORs
\footnote{Relative differences can be evaluated as Relative difference = $\frac{OR_{sex} - OR_{overall}}{OR_{overall}}$}
is very small (relative difference for males: 1.7%, relative difference for females -1.7%).
Although this interaction cannot be discarded, it may not be a true interaction.
One possible explanation for this is the very large magnitude of the effect size (OR circa 27, both overall and in all strata), so the actual difference is larger than the pre-specified (absolute) threshold, but when considering the scale of the measures, the difference may not be perceived as large.
Since there is effect modification, it is recommended that when reporting these results, both stratified OR also be reported, instead of the overall OR alone.

The additional analysis in the next section might shed light on this issue.

#### Additional analyses

In order to assess the possibility that sex is a confounder, the association between sex and the dichotomized responses for both leadership commitment and
<!-- telework satisfaction -->
employee development
were evaluated.
The proportion of participants that perceive high levels of leadership commitment does not vary by sex (p=0.402).
Additionally, the proportion of participants that perceive
<!-- telework satisfaction -->
employee development
do not vary by sex (p=0.195).

Sex is not associated with either leadership commitment or employee satisfaction.
This means that sex is not confounding the overall association of this analysis.
