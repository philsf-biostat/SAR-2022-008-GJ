# Abbreviations

- CI: confidence interval
- FEVS: Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey
- OPM: U.S. Office of Personnel Management

# Context

The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) addressed leadership commitment, professional development, and telework satisfaction while accounting for gender (OPM, 2020).
This analysis addresses a subset of the FEVS survey reflecting NASA employees.

## Objectives

Test if there is an association between leadership commitment and employee professional development at NASA from the 2020 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey.

## Hypotheses

There is a statistically significant correlation between leadership commitment and telework satisfaction among NASA’s employees in a telework environment after accounting for gender (men and women).

## Study design

Survey, with sampling weights accounting for sampling uncertainty.

# Data



## Raw data



## Analytical dataset

All variables in the analytical set were labeled according to the raw data provided and values were labeled according to the data dictionary for the preparation of production-quality results tables and figures.

After the cleaning process 5 variables were included in the analysis with 9633 observations.
Table 1 shows the structure of the analytical dataset.
Raw data was collected as a census of the eligible population (OPM, 2020), and statistical weighting was applied at the data collection to adjust for non-responses in in the census attempt.
These survey weights allow for the estimation of the association under study in the source population.
The raw data is expected to reflect a total employee population at NASA at 16809 employees but after cleaning procedures the observations in the analytical data represents a total of 15283 NASA employees.

The analytical dataset will be included in the private version of the report, and will be omitted from the public version of the report.

# Study variables

## Primary and secondary outcomes

**Specification of outcome measures** (Zarin, 2011):

1. (Domain) employee professional development
2. (Specific measurement) N/A
3. (Specific metric) N/A
4. (Method of aggregation) N/A

**Primary outcome**

This analysis does not evaluate an outcome variable, but instead tests whether or not the distributions of answers from two questions are independent from one another.

## Covariates

The association will be stratified by the sex of survey respondents.

# Statistical methods

## Statistical analyses

### Descriptive analyses

The epidemiological profile of the study participants will be described.
Demographic
(sex, age and BMI)
<!-- and clinical variables -->
<!-- ( [vars] ) -->
will be described as
mean (SD)
<!-- median (IQR) -->
or as counts and proportions (%), as appropriate.
The distributions of participants' characteristics will be summarized in tables and visualized in exploratory plots.

### Inferential analyses

All comparisons between groups will be performed as univariate analyses.
<!-- Continuous variables will be compared between groups with the -->
<!-- independent t test with Welch correction. -->
<!-- paired t test with Welch correction. -->
<!-- Wilcoxon test. -->
Differences in distribution of categorical variables will be assessed with the
<!-- Fisher exact test. -->
chi-square test with the Rao correction for weighted survey data.
<!-- McNemar test. -->

<!-- All inferential analyses will be performed in the statistical models (described in the next section). -->

### Statistical modeling

N/A

### Missing data

No missing data imputation will be performed.
All evaluations will be performed as complete case analyses.

## Significance and Confidence Intervals

All analyses will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
All significance hypothesis tests and confidence intervals computed will be
two-tailed.
<!-- left-tailed. -->
<!-- right-tailed. -->

## Study size and Power

<!-- The G*Power software was used to determine the minimum sample size needed to achieve an 80% statistical power. -->
<!-- Using a Chi-squared statistical test with an alpha value of 5% for the sample size estimate, and an effect size of .5 (medium), the minimum sample size needed was 721. -->
<!-- From the completed surveys of 10,588, a random sampling method was selected to collect 721 completed and usable surveys from the 2020 OPM FEVS. -->
<!-- The researcher used all surveys to meet the inclusion criteria mentioned above to further increase the statistical power (Cohen et al., 2003). -->

N/A

## Statistical packages

This analysis will be performed using statistical software `R` version 4.1.2.
